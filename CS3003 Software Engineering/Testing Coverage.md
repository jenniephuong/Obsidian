what [[Metrics|metrics]] are used for testing coverage
	- line coverage
	- branch coverage
- to ensure the system is tested thoroughly, need to have high line and branch coverage

what is line coverage %
- a percentage of lines of code in the program that have been executed during unit testing
    - If this is equal to 50%, for example, then only half of all the lines in the program have been executed during testing

what is branch coverage %
- the percentage of possible conditions in flow control structures that have been followed during unit test execution
    - Related to the [[McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity|CC]] metric
    - If this is equal to 50%, then only half of the branches in the logic of the code have been executed
