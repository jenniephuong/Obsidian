what are the characteristics of good design
- **Class independence** - high [[Cohesion]] and low [[Coupling]]
- **Fault prevention and fault tolerance** - as more faults can be caused by high coupling and low cohesion (but not always) e.g. automatic repair program at Facebook
- **Shallow and long [[Bathtub Curve]]** - low cohesion and high coupling can have an adverse effect on the bathtub curve and vice versa

[[Pattern|Patterns]] aim to promote good design
