what are the 5 relevant C&K metrics

- [[Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)]]
- [[Depth in the Inheritance Tree of a Class (DIT)]]
- [[Number of Children (NOC)]]
- [[Coupling Between Objects (CBO)]]
- [[Lack of Cohesion of Methods in a Class (LCOM)]]

nobody understands the 6th one

no explicit complexity metric, but ways to use the 5 metrics to understand the overall complexity
