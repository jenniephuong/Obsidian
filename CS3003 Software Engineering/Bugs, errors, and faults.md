what’s the difference between error / bug / failure
- **Error** - something a human makes
- **Bug / [[Fault Proneness|Fault]] / defect** - something put into code as a result of human error (may be found)
- **Failure** - when the bug is found, and the system fails, result of the bug

fix this with [[Debugging]]

small changes tend to be more error prone than large chances (Weinberg 1983) - people are less careful with small changes because they think it’s easy??? hmmm

Failures need to be defined, and include not just a defect but any unexpected behaviour like bugs, lacking usability, missing critical capabilities, and diligently tracked

real life examples
- Y2K bug - i learnt about this bug from a tik tok, the years were only programmed for the last 2 digits 
- PSY Gangnam Style - 32 bit int - could have been prevented by defensive programming??
