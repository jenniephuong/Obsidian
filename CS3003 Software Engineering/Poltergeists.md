> classes with limited responsibilities and roles exist in the system with a limited lifetime

- short-lived, typically stateless object that’s sole purpose is for initialising or setting up other objects and then is no longer needed and disgarded
- ideally, we want certainty in our code where the class has a purpose and doesn’t just exist as an interface (like UserManager) - shows poor object design
