> software systems that are developed especially for an organisation have a long lifetime, many existing systems were developed many years ago using old technologies, but are stull business critical meaning essential for normal functioning of the system

why is changing legacy systems expensive
- different parts implemented by different teams so no consistent programming style
- uses old language
- system documentation out of date
- system structure corrupted after years of [[Maintenance]], [[Bathtub Curve]]

what is the dilemma of legacy systems
- expensive and risky to replace the system, but expensive to maintain it too
- businesses need to weight up the costs and risks and decide to extend the system lifetime using techniques like re-engineering, or replace it
    - uses audit grid

how are legacy systems structured
- more like socio-technical systems and not just software systems comprised of
    - System hardware - may be mainframe hardware
    - Support software - operating systems and utilities
    - Application software - several different programs
    - Application data - data used by these programs that is often critical business information
    - Business processes - the processes that support a business objective and which rely on the legacy software and hardware
    - Business policies and rules - constraints on business operations ![[Pasted image 20241120104013.png]]
