> Object oriented code metrics are used specifically to measure object oriented systems 

why do we need OOC metrics
- since 90s OOC boom, OOP systems can’t be measured with the same metrics as procedural paradigm
- measuring different aspects e.g. inheritance, coupling, cohesion

how can we measure the complexity of object oriented code
- Chidamber and Kemerer’s [[C&K Metrics]] (1991)
