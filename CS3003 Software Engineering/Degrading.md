why does software degrade
- Bugs lead to improper [[Maintenance]] and rush jobs - violating [[Law of Demeter (LoD)]] and [[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)]] and causing quality to worsen, especially during the wear out failure [[Bathtub Curve]] stage
- As code ages and changes (according to [[Lehman's Laws]]), coupling tends to grow, leading to increased complexity
- [[Tech Debt]] rises as a system ages as putting off work on the code now and paying the price later

This coincides with the bathtub curve as software degrades at the point of wear out failures, increasing system decay = more failures

Avoiding software degrading is impossible
