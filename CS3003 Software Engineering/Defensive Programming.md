> a programming technique where you assume the worst for all the inputs

why is defensive programming useful
- helps maintenance (like [[Refactoring]]) because you are insuring for the future
- use in cybersecurity to keep code secure, not only maintainable and less liable to threat and attack

what are the rules of defensive programming
1. never assume anything about the input
2. use standards
3. keep code as simple as possible

explain defensive programming rule 1
- most problems in code come from unexpected input e.g. A negative age or an age >150!

explain defensive programming rule 2
- use and stick to a proper coding standard e.g. position of brackets in java

explain defensive programming rule 3
- reuse whenever possible since it is usually more trusted and documented
	- follows [[Rule of Three]] as instead of copy pasting, better to reuse
