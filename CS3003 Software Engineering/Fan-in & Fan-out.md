> Fan-in: number of modules calling a module
> Fan-out: number of modules called by a module

- Used to measure [[Coupling]]

in this example, assume arrows are going down - directional coupling

is fan in or fan out better?
- refactoring modules with high fan in can be more problematic since we have to consider more connections
