> a project which is believed by participants to be destined for failure, or that requires a stretch of unsustainable overwork - project marches to its death as members are forced to continue the project by their supervisors, against their better judgement

has mental, physical, and functional consequences, the sacrifice of time and personal relationships.

what counts as death march? → 
- the project parameters of a project exceed the norm by at least 50% e.g. schedule compressed due to business competition (most common), staff number reduced, budget and resources reduced (which can lead to less hires, or cheaper less experienced hires), requirements double from business stakeholders
    - size of project (number of people and scale of time) is a key characteristic in defining the death march
        - small scale projects can usually succeed as overtime work last for shorter, and tight knit group are more willing to stick it out to the end
        - large scale projects find it hard to maintain cohesive team spirit, not willing to go overtime for years
    - business stakeholders can cause a death march despite simple system requirements due to business disagreements putting things on hold and causing frustration

what causes a death march?
- politics - power struggle between company vice presidents which created projects for the sake of power and not use / project was set to fail,
- naïve or devious promises made by unexperienced senior staff and management / worst case promises are made to customers knowing it’s not achievable for the sake of sales,
- naïve optimism from the technical staff side, giving optimistic estimates on task completion
- intense market competition e.g. responding to increasing offshore organisations by working onshore folks harder
- intense competition caused by new technology - tech not scalable to large projects and vendors unaware on how to support it properly
- unplanned crisis (hardware/ software vendor went bankrupt, best devs left the team)

why do people even participate in death marches? positive and negative implications
- positive - high right but high reward, Mt. Everest syndrome where you’re more attracted to the challenge
- negative - alternatives are unemployment or bankruptcy, requirement for future advancement like pay rises
