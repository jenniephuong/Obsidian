what are the Lehman Laws
1. **Continuing Change** → A system must be continually adapted else it becomes progressively less satisfactory in use (responding to external changes e.g. not adapting to ISA changes)
2. **Increasing Complexity** → As a system evolves its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it
3. **Continuing Growth** → The functional capability of systems must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over the system lifetime (internal changes new features)
4. **Declining Quality** → Unless rigorously adapted to take into account changes in the operational environment, the quality of a system will appear to decline as it is evolved
5. **[[Feedback System]]** → Evolution processes are multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems

### Evaluating the laws

- law 2 - each arrow is a couple, so this system has more [[Coupling]] as a result of the system growing, making it more complex
- law 3 is a big contradictory to law 2, can we even win.
- law 1 similar to law 4

studies have been done to test Lehman’s laws, but only a small amount of studies, not enough evidence to declare the laws as true-isms

can be observed through practice but not formally documented to verify (company policies preventing documentation shared) -> most software engineers agree they’re okay.

Law 3 shows how the [[Bathtub Curve]] can be affected, as time goes by user expectations change and the ‘useful life’ of a system changes even if it functionally works the same as launch
