> measure of how ‘well intra-connected’ the fields and methods of a class are

[[Cohesion]] of methods in a class promotes encapsulation
- ideally, all methods in the class should use all class instance variables

e.g. B is the ‘least cohesive’ - disjoint use of methods and variables means they could just be split into different classes and A is ‘most cohesive’
