why is LOC not that good metric
- [[Comments]] lines and blank spaces, brackets may or may not be counted
- different ways to count LOC so needs to be specifically defined
- an overused and oversimplified metric
- also dependant on the programming language
- when using tools like SonarQube - some tools can’t deal with syntactically incorrect code affecting the metric calculation

on average developers only write 10 working lines of code a day
