> a class passes a data structure to another class that should not / does not have access to that data structure (ideally the other method should already be encapsulated with the data 

_'send the data to a class with a stamp'_

requires the second class to know how to manipulate the data structure
- we should minimise the amount of data being passed around a system)

what is an example of stamp coupling
- Customer Billing System
	- The print class of a customer billing system accepts part of the huge customer data structure as an argument, parses it, then prints the name, address, and billing information.
