what are code style issues
- Keep code lines short
- Use appropriate indentation
- Declare variables close to where they are used (scope - what other areas are affected and need to be considered, minimise scope)
- Use vertical blank space sensibly
- To associate related things and disassociate unrelated things
- Keep horizontal blank space consistent (indentation)
