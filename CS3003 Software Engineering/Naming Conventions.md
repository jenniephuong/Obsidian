what naming conventions should be used for clean code
- **meaningful** names e.g. `int fileAgeInDays > int d`
- **intention revealing** names `e.g. flaggedCells > list1`
- **pronounceable** names `e.g. modificationTimestamp > modymdhms`
- **searchable** names e.g. not single letter, easily searched in code
- consider **variable name length** e.g. too long or too short is not good
- consider **Java accepted conventions** e.g. i and j for integer indexes

- class and method names should be clear as to what they do, classes as nouns, methods as verbs
