> the practice of designing inputs for generative AI tools that will result in better outputs.

requires an understanding of 
- the domain to incorporate the goal into the prompt like what good or bad responses look like. 
- AI models as different models will respond differently to the same prompt 
	- best to create a prompt template that can be programmatically modified according to some dataset or context ![[Pasted image 20250310161826.png]]
many prompt engineering tools are becoming available.

using techniques like context, decomposition, learning, shot-based

- [[Shot-based Prompting]]
- [[Prompt Chaining]]
- [[Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)]]

##### Pros
- cost-effective 
- flexible to modify 
- quick to develop - e.g. for rapid deployment scenarios 

##### Cons
- less effective in proving coherent and accurate results compared to more advanced techniques like RAG or fine-tuning
