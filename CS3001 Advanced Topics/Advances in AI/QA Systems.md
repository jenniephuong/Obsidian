different types of systems depending on the use case e.g.
- open domain (Qs on any topic), vs. closed domain (specialised to one topic area)
- open book (access external data sources) vs. closed book (rely on knowledge from training)
- conversational (maintain context and continuity over long conversations)  vs. mathematical (answer Qs about mathematical logic and reasoning) vs. visual (combines NLP with computer vision like describe an image or image accessibility)

using LLMs allows for information retrieval

what are the difficulties in creating QA systems 
- need to handle complex language structures
- questions can be phrased in various ways so need advanced NLP understanding 
- need to retrieve relevant information from vast amounts of data 
- answers need to be verified for reliability
