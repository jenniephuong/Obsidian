> Vector (multi-numerical) representations of words/phrases that capture the semantic meanings in a high-dimensional space 

Measure the relatedness of text strings based on how close the embeddings are in the dimensional space -> closer together = semantically similar / related and vice versa

different embedding libraries already exist that existing models use e.g. **==GloVe==**, **==Word2Vec==**

aka. each word represented over a set of numbers e.g. a 3d embedding will have 3 different numbers to make up a piece of text - in real applications there are many more axis than 3
