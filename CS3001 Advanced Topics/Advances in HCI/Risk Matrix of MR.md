- e.g. using headset to produce a video stream of a lecture hall, privacy concerns from whomever is in the video stream
- e.g. surgey, using MR can expose the nurses and patients
- input is a video stream of whatever the wearer is seeing

Simulated elements or actions need to have appropriate mappings to real-world behaviours so that the simulation is intuitive, and the user can focus on experiencing the simulation rather than learning how to use the simulation if it goes against their previous expectations. When presenting new information or feedback, this should be presented gradually and when needed, not all at once to ensure the user can appropriately process each chunk of information. |
