how does Markerless AR work
- does not only rely on marker tracking, but on unprepared tracking and [[SLAM]]
- relies on device technology e.g. cameras, sensors including GPS, compass, accelerator 
- provides higher degree of movement and freedom around the environment as long as the environment can be mapped correctly

types of marker-less AR 
- GPS / location-based - respond to the sensors of your mobile device. It allows for objects to be placed in a certain location and as long as the public has the app,
	- Pros
		- Allows for geographical targeting in tourist hotspots  without requiring expensive outdoor banners
		- Allows for practical applications in terms of directions
	- Cons
		- It is challenging to get precise GEO-located experiences on mobile devices because of lack of sensors accuracy in phones.

- projection-based - focuses on rendering virtual objects within or on a user’s physical space. It is one of the simplest forms of AR where light is projected onto a surface. The interaction occurs by touching the projected surface physically.
- superimposition-based - involves either partial or full replacement of an original view of an object with an augmented view of the same object. In this type of AR, object recognition plays a vital role because an app cannot replace an original object with an augmented one if it cannot identify the original object
- user-defined marker-less

what are the pros of marker-less AR 
- once content is placed in the room it is more flexible than marker-based 

what are the cons of marker-less AR 
- AR content might not make sense in a certain context
- surface needs to have a texture for computer vision to recognise it properly

applications 
- interior design tools to place furniture in user's rooms
- games like pokemon Go
