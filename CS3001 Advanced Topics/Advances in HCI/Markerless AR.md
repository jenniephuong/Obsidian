how does Markerless AR work
- does not only rely on marker tracking, but on unprepared tracking and [[SLAM]]
- relies on device technology e.g. cameras, sensors including GPS, compass, accelerator 
- provides higher degree of movement and freedom around the environment as long as the environment can be mapped correctly

- once content is placed in the room it is more flexible than marker-based 

what are the cons of marker-less AR
