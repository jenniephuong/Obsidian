projecting virtual elements onto the existing physical world, **superimposed** e.g. automobile industry, google glass, Pok√©mon go
- composite view of real world and virtual world
- does not support direct interaction with the virtual elements unless through a screen

Some sort of optical tracking is used:
- ==**marker tracking**== (e.g. ARToolKit square markers or known features in an image) - 10+ years old technology
- ==**unprepared tracking**== tracking in unknown environment (e.g. visual SLAM tracking)

what are the types of AR 
- [[Marker-based AR]]
- [[Markerless AR]]

Haptic feedback can be used to enhance the user experience and provide cues or feedback on certain interactions made.
- Haply - used to mimic different surgical experiences 
- Haptx gloves - mimics touching different materials but requires using 

Other applications include training surgeons before surgery, but requires a lot of equipment to mimic realistic haptics which is bulky to manage. Otherwise less equipment creates poor haptic feedback. 
- need to balance amount of precision with amount of equipment worn

what hardware is required for AR 
- view: through smartphones and tablets, headsets possible e.g. Meta Orion AR Glasses, has a wrist wrap to measure electrical currents through arm as an input device - not mapping recognition to put colliders on skeletal models 
	- notably, can see peoples' eyes 
- interact: uses another device to support interaction (not hands like MR) e.g. external controllers like devices or smartphones to view and interact with the virtual elements

Different implementation types:
- [[App based AR]]
- [[Web based AR]]
