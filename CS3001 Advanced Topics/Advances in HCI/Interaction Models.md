> the ways that we can realistically interact with spatially registered virtual content in the real world, allows realistic manipulation of the virtual object

what are the types of interaction models 
- using hands
- gaze and head tracking - including eye and head tracking
- voice based interactions - define voice commands and implement event handlers that fire whenever the command is said 
	- commands can be specific to the user's current scenario, or always available global commands 

physical controllers DO NOT count as interaction models, as they are made for VR and does not promote an individual interacting with an extension of reality. 

when interacting with the virtual content, [[Collision Detection]] needs to be done.
