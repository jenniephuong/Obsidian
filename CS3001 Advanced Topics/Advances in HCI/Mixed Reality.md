what is mixed reality
- an extension of AR, but the users can actually interact with the virtual content in their real world. AR can only view the virtual content
- implement an environment that extends reality whilst being cognitively able to realise the physical surroundings
    - example includes Microsoft Hololens headset for reconstruction, medical applications, gaming and entertainment
    - directly integrated into the environment a user experiences, not just added on top 


mixed reality can also be defined as the spectrum between the virtuality continuum 
virtuality continuum (Milgram et al.'s)
- full spectrum of technological possibilities between entirely real world reality and fully digital virtual environment![[Pasted image 20250414104841.png]]
- whatever is mixed in between is considered mixed reality
	- within mixed reality is AR and AV 
	- augmented virtuality - superimposes real world elements into a virtual environment 
	- VR is not part of mixed reality
