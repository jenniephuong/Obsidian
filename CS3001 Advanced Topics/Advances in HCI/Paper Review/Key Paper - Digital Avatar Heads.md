TLDR; mixed reality headsets cover part of your face so if you’re working with other people, not seeing their face could make social cues and collaboration harder. what if you artificially add an avatar head to the other people wearing MR head-mounted displays - does it help with anything? Avatars have already shows good user experiences in VR but not studied in MR

Key params: improvements in collaboration, performance, social presence

- e.g. non verbal social cues like eye movements, gaze, facial expressions - these things have already shown impact in collaboration in the real world

Using personal data to model the avatars after, could this be exploited? - the paper also mentions that full body scans could in theory be taken to create renderings of the entire body

Limitations in field of view and latency - creating avatars add complexity to the positioning and rendering process

HMD eye tracking modules to reflect eye movement, microphones or face tracking methods to do lip syncing

#### My thoughts
The paper showed that avatars presenting higher facial expressions allowed participants to have stronger connections, so ImmerseAUTO simulations can also benefit from higher expression avatars to strengthen connections between drivers and passengers to ensure a positive experience.

Also, having more realistic avatars (as opposed to cartoon avatars) will ensure consistency, integrate better with the rest of the simulation, and reduce the user's cognitive load. The paper also showed participants with realistic avatars had faster task completion, so this could also improve user's performance in ImmerseAUTO. However, we should also be cautious on how realistic the avatars are, as realism is inherently subjective and poorly designed 'realistic' models create uncanniness that could serve as a distraction to the user instead of supporting the overall simulation.   
  
The facial tracking technology needs to be robust, as lag or improper tracking can cause the avatars to freeze or give unnatural expressions, which prevents effective communication.
