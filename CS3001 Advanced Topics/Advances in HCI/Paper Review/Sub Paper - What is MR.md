- no single definition of mixed reality, but provides 6 working definitions, and from this definitions, created a conceptual framework for classifying MR experiences

conceptual framework made of 7 dimensions 
- each dimension uniquely identifies a specific notion of MR

- input and output include 
	- using audio, motion, haptics, taste, smell, geolocation for MR 
	- anything that sensors can track can be an input
	- anything sensory can be an output 


AR/MR is more difficult to define than VR 
spatial registration and seeing part of the environment at least is necessary for MR 

how to use the framework to determine which of the 6 definitions are applicable to a certain MR experience 
- e.g. 
- many environments
- one to many users 
- not to partially immersive 
- not and fully virtual
- implicit and explicit interactions
- input = motion
- output = visual
this can be mapped to alignment of environments
