TLDR; In this paper - MR initiatives (mobile AR with tablet, VR with headset Occulus Rift) were tested for health science and medical students across 2 focuses: 
- **_knowledge acquisition_** - anatomy lessons on the brain**
- **_(hands on) skills development**_ - laryngoscopy for foreign body removal with 3D printed tools and AR / VR applications on a phone 
which overall showed improved learning affordances, reduced cognitive load, functional task alignment - interaction and visual based learning more effective than traditional lecture based, also able to deal with isolation factor as using the MR tools made students feel less isolated and alone and involved in the course 
- no negative impacts on their learning 

These new technologies in hybrid allow for learning to be more experiential for students to better understand course material
e.g. 
- BYOD - mechanism for technology to be delivered seamlessly to individuals 
- 3D Printing - allows any digitally designed 3D asset to be printed into a real world object
- AR and VR applications in combination with occulus headsets


what makes a good simulation? 
==**simulation fidelity**== - â€œthe degree to which a simulation looks, feels, and acts like a human patient
- commonly high fidelity is expected, making it costly to have realistic on-site equipment and intensive residential training for health science students to learn
- involves more expensive, cumbersome, and less accessible desktop-based devices
**==physical resemblance==** - might be a better way to promote an effective learning simulation (tactile, visual, auditory, and olfactory features of the simulator) which mixed reality can offer

methodology and evaluation 
- student workshops and giving written feedback

##### Mobile VR app 
pros 
- moving around the skull was helpful 
- more interactive to help them learn

cons 
- dizziness
- difficult to navigate 
- not being able to use well if user wears glasses naturally 

##### Mobile AR app
pros
- portability and availability, no other resources or equipment needed making it accessible 

cons 
- more registration errors and latency - flickering models making it tedious to use 

##### Mixed Reality as a whole 
- combination with other stimuli e.g. audio podcast to describe the process, improving understanding 
- ability to do tasks that are restricted in real world situations e.g. dissecting brainstem which is not possible with a real cadaver, no limit in resources like a limit in number of cadavers HOWEVER
	- technology limitations will always take precedent 
	- the success of this paper was driven by the release of freely available game engines (Unity 3D), free AR/VR SKDs, and mobile devices like tablets and smartphones with GPU processors and high quality screens so that adequate fidelity results could be produced
- supplementary to lecture style content, but not replaceable 
- passes control to the user of the MR, rather than an authority figure -> which also caused set-up issues at the start
- positive reception
