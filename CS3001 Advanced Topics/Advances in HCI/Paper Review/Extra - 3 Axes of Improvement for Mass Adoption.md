What's blocking mixed reality from being adopted by the mass audience as a day to day technology 

#### Applications are invisible, and invisible things are forgettable 
e.g. smartphone apps are forgettable - app overload like puppy installing 500 apps and never uninstalling the ones he doesn't use, this means MR has to show so many virtual elements to remind the user the app features are there 

- having excessive  virtual elements causes UI pollution - overwhelming to deal with 
- address this by - utilise the physical objects as contextual links to applications, rather than user having to search through a list of apps with the MR headset to select the item, have the MR headset automatically open the app when real world objects are picked up or interacted with 

#### Expanding AR and VR beyond our perceptions
- most MR applications are isolated experiences, one-time gimmicky experience before going back to reality instead of integrating through reality 
- we need to change our POV and implementation of MR to make it long-lasting, not just a sandbox experience 
- link to a persistent layer of reality, not tied to the device - the device is a portal to experience, rather than the sole experience 

#### Existing MR experiences are not social
- only the person wearing the headset can see the virtual elements, outsiders are isolated from the experience - singular individual experiences 
- need something similar to how VR can be streamed on twitch, spectator view
