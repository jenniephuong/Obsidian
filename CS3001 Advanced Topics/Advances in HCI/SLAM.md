what is SLAM
- Simultaneous **Localization** and Mapping
    - a technology to perform real time 3D mapping of an area, locate objects (obstacles) in that area, and conduct localization (identify own position in the environment)
    - this is a very important problem in mobile robotics
    - different types, including [[VisualSLAM]], graph SLAM, lidarSLAM, that each use different types of sensors to do the localization and mapping

_NOTE: not only detecting the map of the surroundings, but actively locating where the ‘camera’ or the ‘own’ position is (since the camera is attached to the user though the headset or device)_
