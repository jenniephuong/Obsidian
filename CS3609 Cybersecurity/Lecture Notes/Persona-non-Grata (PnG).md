how can PnGs be used 
- put controls specifically against these archetypes 
- used when mapping social engineering threats

what data can be used to produce a persona non grata
- data on employees
- databases and threat intelligence reports - understand the people behind the threats in that industry 
- news on emerging threat types

what are the pros of PnG
- ideal for early analysis and common team and understanding of potential attackers

what are the cons of PnG
- can overly focus on a subset of threat types - we could miss something out
