>involve the entire system in testing to identify [[Vulnerabilities]] in the system security e.g., software, hardware, users, network, processes - often involving red and blue teams

what are the stages of system testing 
- Reconnaissance - gather information about the system by using public information sources and low-tech methods like telephone or people working there 
- network mapping - use software tools to scan for services that are up and running on systems
- vulnerability testing - use software tools to determine which services are vulnerable to attack
- penetration testing - carry out an attack by exercising one or more vulnerabilities
- mitigation activities - actions taken to reduce the impact of the attack
