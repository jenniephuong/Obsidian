what is a security policy / security statement 
- a document(s) or condensed statement that defines the principles and strategiesÂ needed for an organization to maintain the security of its information assets (and also defining these assets)
	- e.g. 'we want to protect patient data'

what pillars are used to build an organisation' security statement
	consider each factor *where applicable*
- regulations - e.g., (how) standards and rules that must be employed to follow the laws, different for different industries
- organisational objectives - e.g., specific, measurable actions the business wants to achieve
- organisational goals - e.g., long term aims 
- laws - e.g., (what) national and international laws a company needs to follow
- shareholders' interests - e.g., private vs. public organisations have different interests


why is a security policy useful
- sets clear expectations for what appropriate standards are 
- guides the implementation of technical controls through high level expectations
- ensures regulatory and compliance requirements are met 
- ensures the statement is specific to the organisation and their needs (different organisations need to control access to different assets in different ways)
