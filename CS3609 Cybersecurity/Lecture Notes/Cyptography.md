history of cryptography
- not just about securing the content of the data, but the data architecture, adversaries can track where data moves to


what are the two areas of cryptography
- encryption - confidentiality
- hashing things - protecting the integrity


which parts of information security does cryptography satisfy
- [[Confidentiality]] - encryption
- [[Integrity]] - hashing
- [[Availability]]
- [[Non-repudiation]]


what do crypto systems need to balance
- speed and strength
    - weaker techniques may be done faster, to avoid process heavy
    - stronger encryption is more secure but more computationally expensive


what is plaintext 
- the original message

what is ciphertext 
- encrypted message 

[[Cipher]]s are used to turn plaintext into ciphertext 
if the encrypted data is valuable, cybercriminals can try to do [[Cryptanalysis]] attacks


how is cryptography used in different computational architectures
- as analysts, we can decide where to put crypto controls when building the system
	- [[Crypto Controls in System Architectures]]
- as a developer, cryptographic coding approaches can be used for programming the environments 
	- [[Hashing]] 
	- [[Encryption in Coding]] 
- by following [[Cryptography Standards]]


what are the applications of cryptography methods 
- encryption e.g., simple P2P document encryption, symmetric
- hashing - symmetric
- using a [[PKI]] - asymmetric
- [[Blockchain]] - another application



other stuff need to know about 

Private (symmetric) key ciphers 
Public (asymmetric) key ciphers 
Hashing ciphers
