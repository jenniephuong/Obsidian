> how the organisation responds to the identified risk (and as a result risk)

what 2 classes of risk need to be identified during the risk management process
- inherent risk: total currently existing risks = threats x vulnerabilities x asset value
- residual risk: total risk - cumulative effect of controls

what are the residual risks
- the risk that remains after adding more controls, impossible to eliminate all risk, so controls are added to reduce inherent risk to an acceptable level of residual risk

what are the different risk treatment options
- risk mitigation - actions taken to modify and reduce risk, achieved by applying security controls (admin / tech / physical controls)
- risk acceptance - using the output of quantitative and qualitative analysis, if the risk falls within the established risk acceptance criteria it can be accepted as is.
- risk avoidance - re-engineering the system to remove processes which eliminate the risk entirely
- risk transfer - share the risk with a third party either through insurance or outsourcing, 3rd party risk would still need to be considered and a secure vendor evaluated
