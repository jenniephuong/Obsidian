> a framework to show cyber adversary tactics (what benefit / goal does the attacker want to do), techniques (attack vectors - how to execute an attack), and mitigations based on real world observations

With the MITRE ATT&CK framework, cyber security analysts can: 
- Identify an attackerâ€™s behavior by investigating their actions in post-incident analysis. Helpful for the creation of share-able Threat Intelligence, attribution of attack groups and improving knowledge on adversaries. 
- Contribute to the security assessment of a computer network, by identifying attack patterns to understand how [[Attack]]s materialise
- Readily identify Mitigations for Techniques.

can also be used by red and blue teams to simulate attacks

how are threats modelled with MITRE ATTACK
- reviewing all forms of attack from initial access to impact, covering various platforms, responses, techniques and mitigations, moving left to right to map attack vectors

what are the pros of MITRE
- wide range and systematic approach to threats with platforms and counter measures compared to other modelling techniques like [[STRIDE Model]]
