> a framework to show cyber adversary tactics (what benefit / goal does the attacker want to do), techniques (attack vectors - how to execute an attack), and mitigations based on real world observations

With the MITRE ATT&CK framework, cyber security analysts can: 
- Identify an attackerâ€™s behavior by investigating their actions in post-incident analysis. Helpful for the creation of share-able Threat Intelligence, attribution of attack groups and improving knowledge on adversaries. 
- Contribute to the security assessment of a computer network, by identifying attack patterns to understand how [[Attack]]s materialise
- Readily identify Mitigations for Techniques.
