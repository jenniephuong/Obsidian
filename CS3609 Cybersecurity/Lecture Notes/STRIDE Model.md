>threat modelling approach comprising of 6 key threats: 
>spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege

what are the cons of STRIDE
- relies on expertise of staff in production and accurate data flow diagram, if inaccurate then STRIDE modelling will also be inaccurate 
- more effort required to train the staff

what is Spoofing (S)
- refers to a rogue person or program successfully impersonating another legitimate user or program.
- integrity

what is Tampering (T) 
- refers to a threat agent illegitimately modifying application resources, such as in memory data.
- integrity

what is Repudiation (R) 
- refers to a user (legitimate or malicious) able to deny the execution of an action within the system.
- integrity

what is Information disclosure (I) 
- refers to a threat agent obtaining private information s/he is not supposed to access.
- confidentiality

what is Denial of service (D) 
- refers to a threat agent making a system resource unavailable to its intended users.
- availability 

what is Elevation of privilege (E) 
- refers to a threat agent obtaining privileged access to resources that are normally protected.
- confidentiality

how to use the stride model
- identify the system to analyse and visualise it first, e.g. Digital Publishing System, use this to create a stride table
- DFD elements refers to the asset elements e.g. in the exam can put the assets directly e.g.  server, wifi point
    - because dataflow diagram has been made, DFD elements are being assessed
- each column refers to a point in the stride model, with a tick for if it is at risk of being vulnerable to the STRIDE
- this is dependant on my view, and assumption will need to be written
