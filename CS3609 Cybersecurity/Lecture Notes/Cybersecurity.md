>the protection of [[Information Security|Information Systems]] (hardware, software and associated infrastructure), the data on them, and the services they provide, from unauthorised access, harm or misuse. This includes harm caused **intentionally** by the operator of the system, or **accidentally**, as a result of failing to follow security procedures.

who does cybersecurity protect
- information systems, consisting of
    - people - operator
    - physical - infrastructure
    - technical - hardware, software
- data, and services of the system

[[Cybersecurity Analytics]] are used to analyse cyber security problems

what are the key considerations in cybersecurity?
1. the threat landscape - what to protect
    1. e.g. what happening around the world, which industry and what industry specific attacks are there
2. how do we design cybersecurity
    2. incorporate within the system architecture
3. how do we implement cybersecurity
    1. physical (data centre security access cards), electronic, administrative
4. what are the risks, impacts and controls?
    2. e.g. implementing a data centre, risk analysis before, impact of attacks, and control includes prevention and response


_**why do we need cybersecurity?**_
- business continuity - e.g. bank attacks causes all transactions to stop, greatly impact the business if services stop (function)
- competitive advantage - e.g. comparing 2 banks to invest in, choose on which has the less history of cyber attack
- reputation - (Royal bank of Scotland) repeated attacks ruins trust, hard to recover public relations
- Return on investment - need to protect the investment in order to get the return
- shareholder value - how will shareholders get dividends if funds not secure
- privacy - GDPR (Europe) DPA (UK)
- legal obligation - following regulations before getting certifications or approval for businesses starting
- IP -
- supply chain integrity - e.g. value of the product will go down if supply chain is impacted and hacked

we are living in an increasingly digital world, handheld devices, cars, healthcare. the more we have digitally, the more criminals have access to move around and attack us
