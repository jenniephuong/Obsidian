how does DPA and GDPR compliance impact companies
- DPA for UK, GDPR for EU 
- if companies don't follow these regulations they can be fined 
- data breaches must be responded to within 72 hours or a hefty fine will be issued. This could potentially amount to €20 million (approx £17.6m) or 4% of a firm's global turnover (whichever is greater)
