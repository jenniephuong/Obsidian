what is a quantitative risk methodology
- uses numerically based (hard), objective data 
- measures monetary units (expenses, whether itâ€™s worth investing into these security measures)
- based on the ability of experts to estimate the risk in financial terms

what calculations are done in the quantitative risk methodology
- **Asset Value (AV)** - value of the asset 
- **Exposure Frequency (EF)** - frequency at which the [[Threats|threat]] will occur
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)** - the financial loss when the [[Threats|threat]] is realised 1 time 
- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** - number of incidents per year
- **Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE)** - maximum amount to spend on the protection of [[Assets]]

how do you calculate SLE
- SLE = AV x FE

how do you calculate ALE
- ALE = SLE x ARO

how do we calculate the value of a security [[Controls|control]]
- value = ALE before control - ALE after control - annual maintenance cost of the control 
- this value can help us determine whether it is worthwhile to implement the security control or not, positive value = implement the control
