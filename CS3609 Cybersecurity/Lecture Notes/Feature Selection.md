when is feature selection done
- as part of the pre-processing stage

why is feature selection important
- irrelevant features can introduce noise, which can adversely effect the results
- not all features are needed, need to focus only on the most important ones

what are the different feature selection methods
- filters - ranking of features on their intrinsic values to take a subset of the data
- wrappers - use classifiers to evaluate the importance of features to subsets of the data 
- embedded - include the feature selection process as part of the learning algorithm
