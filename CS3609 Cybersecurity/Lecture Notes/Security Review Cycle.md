> A systematic process for assessing and improving an organization's security measures

what is the difference between [[Risk Management Framework]] and security review cycle
- risk management framework focuses on _**what**_ risk there is and what controls and policies need to be implemented as a result
- security review focuses on _**how**_ effectively they have been implements, and how to continually improve on this

why is it a cycle 
- security is a daily affair, meaning it does not happen only 1 time, but needs to be enforce continually 

what are the stages in the Security Review Cycle 
- secure 
- monitor
- audit
- improve

what is the secure stage
- implement the security measures as described in the RMF


what is the monitor stage
- monitor the effectiveness of the security measures on the system e.g. monitor network traffic and users, use of resources, performance of the system
- use tools like IDS to identify any suspicious activity to automate monitoring, get alerts, and review logs


what is the audit stage
- identify any patterns based on the monitoring stage to determine what works well, what needs to be improved
- ensure compliance with relevant policies like GDPR


what is the improve stage
- implement improvements based on the results from the audit stage
- as new software updates become available, update, or move to new technologies


**when** should organisations apply the system security
- can be applied at the start of the development lifecycle for new systems following through to every stage (devSecOps) 
- apply monitoring to existing live systems even after the development is complete 


**where** can the security cycle be applied to 
- used to test live systems
- or instead, create a simulated system to virtually test the system (cyber-range)
- software architecture like flowcharts and code files can also be used to detect issues in security e.g. are they encrypted or clean
