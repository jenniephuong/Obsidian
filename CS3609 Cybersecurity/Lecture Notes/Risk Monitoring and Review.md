> risks are not static and can change abruptly so need continuous monitoring to identify changes and maintain their complete overview of the [[Threat Landscape]] e.g. new assets in risk management scope, new internal or external threats, new InfoSec incidents, vulnerabilities are being searched for to be exploited by criminals all the time


what is involved in **risk monitoring and reporting**
- input → all risk related information obtained from the risk management process
- activities → monitor and review risks and the risk factors (asset value, impacts, threats, vulnerabilities, security controls, likelihood)
- output → continual alignment of risk management with business objectives of the organisation, and with the risk acceptable criteria
