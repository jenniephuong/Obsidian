what are the benefits of AAA servers 
- less administration time as users accounts are maintained on a single host 
- reduces design errors as different access devices use similar formats
- reduces security admin training as only 1 system needs to be learned
- easier for compliance auditing as all requests are on 1 system
- less help-desk calls as the UI is consistent
- easier to manage for large number of users as all AAA processes are done in one place

what are the cons of AAA servers
- if it fails, large number of users are affected and can't access system
