what is XDR
- extended detection and response
- unifies multiple security tools and data sources within a system to enhance threat detection and response across diverse environments, reducing the time and complexity of managing separate tools

what are the features of XDR
- use AI to collect, correlate, and analyse data from endpoints
- creates more accurate and context driven analytics which are used to automate actions
- prioritise data and delivers insights in a normalised way to bring more holistic situational awareness
- coordinates security tools to streamline security analysis and investigation
- allows for cross-layer threat detection and can uncover threats that might not be visible when looking at security tools individually 

how does XDR compare to SIEM and SOAR
- SIEM that only uses log data, and can be used outside of threat detection like for compliance and data analysis for management functions
- SOAR which focuses on automation rather than deep analytics, and SOAR can orchestrate the optimisation of resources and prioritise activities 

do organisations need SIEM, SOAR, and XDR, all together
- most small organised don't have resources for all three so stick to SIEM and SOAR, but large companies with resources can use all three
- can replace SIEM and SOAR as it streamlines the entire process
- can work together where SIEM feeds into XDR, and SOAR carries out automated incident responses based on XDR detections and insights

when to use SIEM vs. SOAR vs. XDR
- stick to XDR when complex IT is involved since it provides a broader view on threat detection
- stick to SIEM if the organisation cares primarily about compliance reporting or log management 
- stick to SOAR if increased incident automation is needed
