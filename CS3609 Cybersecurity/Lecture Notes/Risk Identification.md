Part of the [[Risk Assessment]]

what are the aims of risk identification
- **identification of [[Assets]]** - in the event that a threat is realised, most important assets need to be restored first
- **identification of [[Threats]]** - some threats impact infrastructure, while pandemic threat impacts personnel and business operations
- **identifications of existing [[Controls]]**
- **identifications of [[Vulnerabilities]]**
- **identifications of Impact** - usually in a Disaster Recovery Plan, planning for wide reach impact disaster is more comprehensive than focusing on single impact issues (but specific scenario impact planning still important)

The output of risk identification is usually a risk register - a list of all identified risks containing information of each risk. risk identification is importance since organisations can’t prepare for potential risks that they don’t know about
