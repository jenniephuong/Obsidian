>a network layer protocol that devices use within a network to communicate problems with data transmission e.g. whether data reaches its destination in a timely manner

has 'ping' utility 
- when one device sends an ICMP echo request packed to a target device to see if it is reachable, if it is then a ping is sent back, allows for latency to be measured and device availability to be determined

can be used to detect the flow of traffic
- and based on this, detect if there is a problem with the system 
- e.g. if a request is using the incorrect protocols
