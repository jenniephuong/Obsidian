how to monitor
- large organisations canâ€™t do monitoring individually and manually, can use automated tools to support the monitoring of systems
	- humans get tired and make errors
- when tool identifies issues it can create alerts - delegate actions to a few humans to manage instead of fully responsible for 
- especially for complex organisations that span across worldwide

conduct real time monitoring with [[Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]]

e.g. Zabbix
