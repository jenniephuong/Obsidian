how can we review complex systems to understand where to put cryptographic controls 

- Look at the system at a high level - understand the services, software, hardware, people that they use, how services move between the systems![[Pasted image 20250416122049.png|500]]

	or 

- Look at the network at a high level -  using a network diagram to identify points where cryptographic controls can be added e.g., if a network is spread across countries ![[Pasted image 20250416122215.png|500]]

based on this review, different infrastructure can be implemented to allow cryptography 
alt. example infrastructures that can be reviewed 
- Client-Server 
- [[Message Based Architecture]]
- [[Serverless Computing]]
- [[Blockchain]] Trading Architecture 

need to understand when to choose each architecture e.g. what are the merits of implementing a blockchain infrastructure instead of coding a full client- server system
