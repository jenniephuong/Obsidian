>simulations where entities called agents are programmed to behave and interact with each other and their environment according to pre-defined rules 

what does ABS consist of 
- agents
- environments
- behaviour
- baselining

what is the agent in ABS 
- autonomous entities (can act on its own)

what is the agent's role in ABS
- numerous interacting agents make up a system, so that when the system is run emergent properties should be seen e.g. agents might cluster together in some way or multiply in some way
- each agent acts and responds based on if else conditions 
- agent properties can be defined and changed with rules e.g. should delete files when agent enters the system
- different agent rules (either simple or complex) results in different system behaviour

what can agents model
- a specific attack like virus, malware, worm
- the attacker and the attacked
- phishing emails (for social engineering modelling)
- hardware and software elements

what can environments model 
- geography or maps
- networks 
- buildings
- office layouts and desks

what is the behaviour in ABS
- agents have dynamic behaviour - network nodes can change over time e.g.
	- rules created for when nodes become connected to viruses 
	- rules for spreading a virus

what is baselining in ABS
- establishing a reference point or default simulation

how is baselining used 
- used to test a hypothesis e.g. the effectiveness of a control or tool in reducing of solving the issue e.g. virus 
- uses as a comparison point e.g. compare the baseline of the simulated network infection to the actual spread

how many simulations should you run
- Simulations need to be run multiple times and then average taken (key performance indicators, KPI measured)

how can ABS be done
- with software like Netlogo which runs in the web browser
- in code with python
