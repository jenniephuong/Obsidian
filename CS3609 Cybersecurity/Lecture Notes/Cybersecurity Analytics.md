>the application of intelligent data analysis, data mining and artificial intelligence techniques to analyse cyber security problems.


what areas can analytics be applied to 
- the entire [[Cyberspace Operating Environment]]


why do organisations need cybersecurity analytics
- optimisation - not just to determine if an attack is happening, but gives insight into the asset values, allowing them to resource plan better and work more efficiently
- legal requirements - will be monitored by the government, and ensure they are compliant with the rules they need to obey through auditing, internal investigations, and law enforcement
- strategic - requirements based on the key performance indicators e.g. KPI, helps companies set KPI and conduct risk assessment.
- prediction - use analytics to predict future attacks based on past attack history, and will improve business resilience and preparations
- situational awareness - analytics help us identify what is happening in the network, is there an ongoing attack and what is the target of the attack, allows business to make better decisions in those situations, based on specific situations as opposed to general protection


what are examples of analytics that can be measures for the 5 purposes 
![[Pasted image 20250422095611.png]]


what types of data sources are available that can be analysed with analytics
- network monitoring logs - data collected for ensuring the network is operating security, hints of cyberattacks appear here
- host logs - machine and terminal logs
- physical logs - from existing physical security measures
- employees - insight from the employees, either intentionally which could cause insider attack, could detect this by looking for suspicious behaviour on social media
- suppliers - other companies which the organisation works with
- customers
- OSINT - open source intelligence - includes Mitre Attack, all previous data can be compared against OSINT


give examples of specific data sources 
![[Pasted image 20250422100303.png]]
- network architecture - tells us what assets we have and the connectivity, allows for an attack path to be created, network segmentation will prevent the jumping of hosts, understand how an attack evolved and where it came from
- network scans - identify potential weak spots in infrastructure
- firewall logs - identify who tried to abuse the service where the vulnerability is, e.g. notice an attack call and find the target IP
- [[Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)|IDS]] logs - identify abnormal behaviours
- PCAP - pocket capture, network captures that contains the pocket data of the network and understand its characteristics
- server and system logs
- geographical information - e.g. logging in from another unexpected geographical location to determine any suspicious behaviour
- social media - can highlight angry employees who have a motive

[[Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]] work by measuring and analysing analytics


what considerations do experts need to take when conducting data analysis
- know the specifics of the techniques that they will use 
	- live or historic analysis
	- diagnostic or predictive
	- the focus of the analytical approach
- know the nature of the data that can be analyses
	- data quality and reliability
	- data granularity
	- big or small data
- data practicalities 
	- pre-processing the data ([[Feature Selection]])
	- storing the data 
	- data protection
- any other uncertainties
