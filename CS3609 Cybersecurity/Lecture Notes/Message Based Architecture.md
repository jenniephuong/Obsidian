>messages are encrypted, however, need to consider exactly what part of the message is encrypted so that messages can route correct without giving away compromising information 

used for trading systems, built upon client server

e.g. if a trade has been made to someone in hong kong from uk
- the message needs to be routed to hong kong
- but the header can't be encrypted otherwise it won't route correctly 
	- possibly hash instead
- the body can be encrypted
